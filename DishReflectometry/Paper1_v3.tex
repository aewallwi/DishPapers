\begin{abstract}
Spectral structure from instrumental systematics is the current
limiting factor for the experiments attempting to detect the redshifted 21~cm
signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). 
Recent advances in the delay spectrum methodology for measuring the
21~cm EoR power spectrum have brought new attention to the impact that
the frequency performance of antenna elements has on the viability of
making this challenging measurement.
%Systematics are specific to
%instruments and their direct measurement or estimation is not always
%straightforward. 
%The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) uses the delay
%spectrum technique for estimating of 21~cm power spectrum. 
In particular, the delay spectrum formalism provides a relationship
between time-domain reflectrometry profiles that can be directly
measured with a vector network analyzer (VNA) and the power spectrum modes accessible
to a 21~cm EoR experiment.
%In a unique way, the
%delay spectrum technique directly translates to reflectometry in case of
%measuring instrumental response and allows the direct measurement of systematic
%effects in individual array element.  
In this paper, we derive the explicit relationship between $S_{11}$ measurements
made by a VNA and the corresponding convolving kernel in delay space.
Using this formalism, we examine
the spectral chromaticity of the prototype antenna elements that
constitute Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) 
between 100 and 200~MHz.
These reflectometry measurements exhibit spurious chromatic structure relative
to electromagnetic simulations, but we find 
that even without compensating for this structure, the antenna element
will support measuring $k$ modes with line-of-sight components 
$k_{\parallel} >0.2 h~Mpc^{-1}$.  
%The performance is significantly better at the high frequency subbands of observation. 
When combined with the powerful foreground weighting methods used in optimal
quadratic estimation,
HERA should be capable of measuring the
power spectrum at $k_{\parallel} > 0.1$. This study
qualifies HERA as a power spectrum instrument and serves as an
important method for designing and measuring instrumental systematics for any future
experiment aiming to detect the 21~cm EoR power spectrum.

\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

Since it was first proposed in ~\citep{Shaver_et_al1999} measuring 21~cm
emission from neutral hydrogen in our early universe has gained attention as a
powerful probe of both cosmology and astrophysics.  While the science case for
21~cm cosmology, particularly during the Epoch of Reionization, is well
established (see, e.g.,
~\cite{furlanetto_et_al2006, morales_wyithe2010, pritchard_loeb2012}),
the technical path toward measuring this signal has been extremely challenging.  The
weakness of this hyperfine line keeps the 21~cm signal below opacity throughout
cosmological history, but it also creates sensitivity and calibration
challenges that are yet to be fully solved.  With noise temperatures dominated
by sky noise and foregrounds four to five orders of magnitude
brighter than the signal, 
sky-averaged 21~cm monopole experiments such as
EDGES; ~\citep{Bowman_et_al2010},
BIGHORNS; ~\citealt{2015PhDT........65V},
SARAS; ~\citep{Patra_et_al2015}, \citep{Patra_et_al2013} ,
SCIHI; ~\citep{2015PhDT........65V},
HYPERION; ~\citep{presley_et_al2015}
% XXX others?
and 21~cm reionization power spectrum experiments such as
the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR; ~\citealt{van_Haarlem_2013}),
the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA; ~\citealt{Tingay_2013}),
the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT; ~\citealt{Paciga_et_al2011}),
the Donald C. Backer Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER; ~\citealt{parsons_et_al2010}),
the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA; ~\citealt{deBoer_2016}),
and the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA; ~\citealt{XXX})
must furnish both their foreground suppression limits given their system performance at levels significantly
beyond anything previously achieved in radio telescopes operating below 1 GHz.

One of the most problematic effects facing these experiments is instrument
chromaticity.  The spectral dimension of 21~cm reionization experiments is of vital
importance; for line emission, this coordinate translates to a line-of-sight distance
that can be used to construct three-dimensional maps (and power spectra) of emission,
as well as probe the evolution of 21~cm emission over cosmological timescales.
The evolving response of a radio telescope --- either a single dish
or an interferometer --- versus spectral frequency modulates spectrally smooth foregrounds,
contaminating spectral modes that might
otherwise be used to measure reionization ~\citep{liu_et_al2014a}.  Moreover, the chromaticity of
a telescope's response scales linearly with diameter, putting the
needs of foreground suppression and signal sensitivity in direct tension with one
another. In addition to that, systematic effects are unique to each instrument and their manifestation 
is different in each dataset.

A major step forward for the field of 21~cm cosmology has been the development
of a mathematical description of telescope chromaticity, how it varies with
element separation (or telescope diameter), and what it implies for distinguishing
foreground emission from the cosmological 21~cm signal~\citep{Thyagarajan_et_al2015}.  The ``wedge'', as it is
colloquially known, describes a linear relationship between the separation between elements
in an interferometric baseline and the maximum line-of-sight Fourier mode\footnote{Assuming
a flat sky and using appropriate
cosmological scalars,
the spectral axis, $\nu$, and angle on the sky, $\vec\theta$, translate to coordinates in
a three-dimensional volume at cosmological distances.  In describing the spatial power spectrum of
emission in this volume $P(\vec k)$, we use the three-dimensional wave vector 
$\vec k\equiv(k_\parallel,\vec k_\perp)$, where $k_\parallel$ is aligned with the
spectral axis, $\nu$, and $\vec k_\perp$ lies in the plane of the sky.}
that may be occupied by smooth spectrum foreground emission.  At low-order $k_\parallel$ modes
within the limits of the wedge,
foreground contamination may be suppressed through a combination of calibration and model 
subtraction.  However, calibration or modeling errors rapidly re-establish the characteristic
wedge pattern.  Outside of the wedge, foreground contamination drops rapidly 
~\citep{pober_et_al2013},\citep{Thyagarajan_et_al2015}, provided that the spectral responses
of antenna elements and analog electronics are sufficiently smooth\footnote{Here, we distinguish
the chromaticity of the elements in isolation from the chromaticity inherent to
element separation in an interferometric baseline.}.  In the promising, avoidance-based
foreground strategy employed by PAPER ~\citep{parsons_et_al2014},\citep{Ali_et_al2015}, these modes
may be targeted as the lowest risk path for constraining 21~cm reionization in the near term.

The efficacy of the techniques of foreground removal from the measured data
critically limits the 21~cm power spectrum measurements. The delay
transformation technique of foreground removal, introduced by
~\citep{Parsons_Backer_2009},\citep{Parsons_et_al_2012}, computes the Fourier
transform of the visibility measured by an interferometer and produces a
spectrum, referred to as the delay spectrum hereafter, which is a function of
the geometric time delay corresponding to the physical length of the baseline
between two antennas. For the visibilities measured over a wide field across a
wide frequency bandwidth, the delay spectrum consists of the instrument
response, the foreground signal, and the 21cm power spectrum, hereafter
referred to as the EoR signal.
%The complex visibility measured by an interferometer is a convolution of the instrument response with the true sky response in the UV plane. Therefore, when Fourier transformed, the delay spectrum is the multiplication of the sky response with the instrument response in the delay domain.
The technique exploits the smooth spectral characteristics of the foreground
and for a widefield wide bandwidth visibility measurement by an interferometer
with a baseline $b$, confines the foreground contribution to the computed delay
spectrum within the largest possible time delay, $\tau = b/c$, corresponding to
the given baseline length. Such techniques also assume a spectrally smooth
instrumental response whose contribution to the measured data, much as the
contribution of the smooth spectrum foreground, also has an upper bound in the
delay space imposed by the largest geometric delay of the given baseline.
Beyond this limit, for an ideal system performance, the delay spectrum would be
dominated by any wideband signal across the sky with spectral and spatial
fluctuations over small scales, such as the EoR signal, and therefore, could be
detectable. The interaction between the sky signal and instrument response can
alter the relative contribution of the foreground, instrument response and the
EoR signal at a given delay and, thus, influence the detectability of the EoR
signal. Such interactions may cause the foreground and systematics to spill
over into higher delays and, thus, push the upper limit of the foreground and
systematics contaminated delay modes to much higher delays. In this process,
the EoR signal over large spatial scales will be lost. \\

\indent The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a proposed array
consisting of 568 14-m dishes in South Africa which will measure the 21~cm
power spectrum between 100 to 200~MHz.
In this paper, we investigate the performance of an individual HERA element and
the resulting manifestation of the instrument response to the delay spectrum.
Reflectometry measurements  are carried out across a wide bandwidth on a
prototype HERA element in Green Bank, WV (Figure \ref{fig:heradish}), and the
results are interpreted in light of the delay spectrum technique of power
spectrum estimation and inverse covariance weighting method of foreground
suppression. Section 2 briefly describes the delay spectrum for the ideal and
non-ideal performance of a two element interferometer. Section 3 describes the
reflectometry measurements and establishes the connection between visibility
measurements and reflectometry. Reflectometry results are described in section
5. Section 6 evaluates the performance of the HERA element for detection of the
21~cm power spectrum.

This paper is one in a series of four papers that studies the time and frequency domain simulation of  HERA element~\citep{Ewall-Wice_et_al2016}, ~\citep{ddboer_et_al2016},beam pattern measurements~\citep{Neben_et_al2016}, and foreground limits ~\citep{Thyagarajan_et_al2016}. We compare 
reflectometry measurements to the simulated specification for the spectral performance of a HERA element ~\citep{ddboer_et_al2016} and to the limits of EoR to foreground power ratio established by ~\citep{Thyagarajan_et_al2016}.

\section{\textbf{Visibility measurements by a two element interferometer and the delay spectrum}}
Consider a two element interferometer with a baseline $\vec b$. If we denote the electric field sky signal in the direction $\thhat$ by $\volt_\sky(\vec \theta, \nu)$, then the voltage output of each antenna may be written as,  

\begin{equation}
\volt_{1}(\thhat, \nu) = \bmvolt_{1}(\thhat,\nu)\volt_\sky(\thhat,\nu)\nonumber\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\volt_{2} (\thhat, \nu)= \bmvolt_{2}(\thhat,\nu)\volt_\sky(\thhat,\nu)\fngexp\nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Hence, the time averaged visibility measured by the interferometer may be written as, 
\begin{equation}
\vis(\vec b, \nu) =  \int  \volt_{1}(\thhat,\nu)  \volt_{2}^{*} (\thhat, \nu) \ifngexp d\Omega 
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}

We define the antenna cross power pattern as  $\beam(\thhat,\nu)=\bmvolt_{1}(\thhat,\nu)\bmvolt_{2}^{*}(\thhat,\nu)$ and denote the sky intensity as  $I_\sky(\thhat,\nu)=\volt_\sky(\thhat,\nu)\volt_\sky^{*}(\thhat,\nu)$. Hence, 
\begin{equation}
\vis(\vec b,\nu) = \int \beam(\thhat, \nu) I_\sky(\thhat,\nu) \ifngexp d\Omega
	%	& = & \int B(l,m, \nu) I_{sky}(l,m,\nu) exp(-2\pi i \nu \tau_{g} ) dl dm \nonumber\\
 	%	& = & B(\vec u,\nu) \ast P_{sky}(\vec u,\nu ) \nonumber\\
	%	& = & B(\nu { |\vec b| \over c} , \nu) \ast P_{sky}(\nu { |\vec b| \over c} , \nu) \nonumber\\
	%	& = & B(\tau_{g}, \nu) \ast P_{sky}(\tau_{g} , \nu)	
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}

%i.e, the complex visibility is the Fourier transform of the product of the antenna beam pattern with the sky angular power spectrum. In other words, it is the convolution of the Fourier transform of the antenna power pattern with the Fourier transform of the sky. The complex visibility measured by an interferometer with a given baseline length has explicit dependence on frequency as well as implicit frequency dependence through the spatial frequency $\vec u = \nu { \vec b \over c}$ component. Since $\vec u $ is the For a given baseline length $|\vec b|$, the visibility measured at various frequencies are not only the function of frequencies but also samples different $\vec u$ in the uv space. Delay transformation technique takes the visibility measurements at different frequencies and Fourier transforms the complex visibilities. If we defineI_{sky} the Fourier conjugate of the frequency axis as $\tau$ then the equation could be written as, 
In ~\citet{parsons_et_al2012a}, the Fourier transform of the visibility along the frequency axis was introduced,
resulting in the delay spectrum:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde V(\vec b, \tau) & = & \int\!\![{\beam(\vec b,\nu)*I_\sky(\vec b,\nu)] ~e^{-2\pi i\nu\tau}d\nu}%\nonumber\\	                        %& = &   \left [ A(\vec b, \tau)\ast I_{sky}(\vec b, \tau) \ast \delta( \tau - \frac{{\vec {b} \cdot \thhat}}{c} )\right ] d\Omega 
\label{eq3}
\end{eqnarray}
% XXX rethink how to express this equation (not correct about integrated over all sky)
% XXX define tau_g
The convolution is carried out along the $\tau$ axis which is Fourier conjugate of the frequency $\nu$. 
The redshifted 21 cm spatial power spectrum is defined as
\begin{equation}
  P_{21}(k_\perp,k_\parallel) = (|\tilde V(\vec b, \tau)|^{2} \left(\frac{1}{\Omega\Delta B}\right)\left(\frac{D^2\Delta D}{\Delta B}\right)\left(\frac{\lambda^2}{2k_\textrm{B}}\right)^2 ,
\label{eq4}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  k_\perp = \frac{2\pi f}{D}\Bigg({b\over c}\Bigg), \text{ }
  k_\parallel = \frac{2\pi\tau\,f_{21}H_0\,E(z)}{c(1+z)^2}, 
 \label{eq5}
\end{equation}
The power spectrum is a function of cosmological as well as instrumental parameters which are:\\
$f_{21}$:rest frame frequency of the 21~cm radiation.\\
$f$: observation frequency.\\
$z$: cosmological redshift corresponding to the frequency of observation.\\
 $\Delta B$: bandwidth centered at the observation frequency.\\
 $k_\textrm{B}$: Boltzmann constant.\\
 $D\equiv D(z)$ comoving distance along the line of sight\\
 $\Delta D$ the comoving distance along the line of sight corresponding to bandwidth of observation $\Delta B$.\\
$E(z)= [\Omega_\textrm{M}(1+z)^3+\Omega_\textrm{k}(1+z)^2+\Omega_\Lambda]^{1/2}$ \\
\indent In this paper, we use $\Omega_{M}=0.27$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$, $\Omega_{K}=1-\Omega_{M}-\Omega_{\Lambda}$, $H_0=100 h^{-1}\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, and $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ is in units of K$^2 (h^{-1}$~Mpc$)^3$.

\indent Since both $k_{\perp}$ and $k_{\parallel}$ are functions of the delay
$\tau$, corresponding to the given baseline length, the redshifted 21 cm power
spectrum could be estimated from the delay spectrum of the visibility measured
by an interferometer. The sky delay spectrum from any direction $\thhat$ is
convolved with the delay spectrum of the instrument and would be located at the
delay $\tau = {\vec b \cdot \thhat \over c}$ %defined this differently earlier
 in the delay domain. The maximum geometric delay possible for a given baseline would be $\tau_{g} ={ b \over c }$ for the direction of $\thhat = 0$, when the phase centre is halfway in between the two antennas. %The phase center is elsewhere defined as being at the center of one of the antennas.
 Hence, the sky contribution from any direction would be confined within
$-\tau_{g}<\tau<\tau_{g}$. Due to the chromaticity of the sky signal as well as
the instrument response, the delay spectrum of the sky spills over into delays
with $\tau> \tau_{g}$, with a decaying amplitude [Ref to the Figure Parsons12].
The foreground, $P_{fg}(\tau)$, which is spectrally smooth, and the 21~cm power
spectrum, $P_{21}(\tau)$, which contains spectral signatures, contribute to the
sky delay spectrum $P_{sky}(\tau)$.Therefore, in the spill over region
$(\tau>\tau_{g})$, the relative strength of the smooth spectrum foreground,
with respect to the delay spectrum of the $I_{21}$, reduces and the 21cm delay
spectrum could be detectable.

 %In words, the sky delay spectrum from any direction $\thhat$ is convolved with the delay spectrum of the instrument and would be located at the delay $\tau = {\vec b \cdot \thhat \over c}$ in the delay domain. The maximum geometric delay possible for a given base line would be $\tau_{g} ={ b \over c }$ for the direction of $\thhat = 0$ when the phase centre is halfway in between the two antennas. Hence, the sky contribution from any direction would be confined within $-\tau_{g}<\tau<\tau_{g}$. Due to chromaticity of the sky signal as well as instrument reponse, the delay spectrum of the sky spills over the delay $\tau> \tau_{g}$ with decaying amplitude [Ref to the Figure Parsons12]. Sky delay spectrum $I_{sky}(\tau)$ is contributed by the foreground  $I_{fg}(\tau)$  which is spectrally smooth and the 21~cm power spectrum $I_{21}(\tau)$ which contains spectral signatures. Therefore, in the spill over region $(\tau>\tau_{g})$, the relative strength of the smooth spectrum foreground with respect to the delay spectrum of the $I_{21}$ reduces and the 21~cm delay spectrum could potentially be detectable.

\section{\textbf{Effects of multiple reflections on visibility and delay spectrum}}

The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array consists of parabolic dishes which
provide increased collecting area per array element compared to its predecessor
experiment PAPER. Plane waves incident on a parabolic dish are focussed at the
feed which is kept at the focal plane of the dish.  The mismatch between the
impedance of free space and the feed and transmission line results in a partial
coupling of the sky signal into the feed while the rest is reflected off the
feed.  The reflected signal illuminates the dish and most of it is reflected
back into the space.  However, a part of it reflects back and forth several
times in between the feed and the vertex of the dish which is shadowed by the
feed.  Such reflections generate multiple copies of the incident sky signal of
reduced strength at various delay and phase and thus produces spurious
correlations in the visibilities of interferometric data.  Identical spurious
visibilities could be resulted due to reflections internal to the system
causing delay space distortion. Therefore, it is necessary to measure and
understand the instrument delay spectrum in order to qualify the system for the
measurement of 21cm power spectrum.  In this section we compute the visibility
of a two element interferometer accounting for the additional reflections of
the sky signal in between the feed and the dish vertex and the corresponding
effects on the delay spectrum in detail. We assume two antennas with identical
geometry and electrical parameters i.e,
$\bmvolt_{1}(\thhat,\nu)=\bmvolt_{2}(\thhat,\nu) = \bmvolt(\thhat,\nu)$. 

 \subsection{Antenna Reception With Multiple Reflections}
\label{sec:multiple}

To examine the performance of an antenna and feed in the presence of multiple
reflections, we can think of the system as a screen at a distance $F$ from a
feed (see Figure \ref{fig:sys}), noting that this does ignore the sky pattern
of the feed itself.  The screen reflects a factor, $\Gamma_d$, of the voltage
and transmits $(1+\Gamma_d)$ (see, {\em e.g.} Pozar).  Similarly, the feed
reflects $\Gamma_f$ and transmits $(1+\Gamma_f)$.  The voltage pattern
$\volt_{sky}$ is incident onto that system and  $(1+\Gamma_{d})(1+\Gamma_{f})$
is coupled into the cable leading from the feed.  Additionally, however, the
voltage pattern is reflected off the feed ($\Gamma_f$), then the dish
($\Gamma_d$) and subsequently $(1+\Gamma_{f})$ of it reenters the feed with a
roundtrip time delay $\Delta \tau=2F/c$. Hence, if $v_{sky}$ is reflected $n$
times in between the feed and the dish, the net voltage entering the feed after
the $n^{th}$ reflection may be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\volt_{rec} & = &  (1+\Gamma_d) (1+\Gamma_{f}) \volt_{sky}[1+ \Gamma_{f}\Gamma_{d} \dfngexp \nonumber \\
	&& + (\Gamma_{f}\Gamma_{d})^2  (\dfngexp)^{2}+ \nonumber \\

%Defining $a=\volt_{rec}/\volt_{sky}$ and we see that 
Hence,
 \begin{eqnarray}
{\volt_{rec}\over \volt_{sky} } & = &   (1+\Gamma_d)(1+\Gamma_{f}) \displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^{N} [\Gamma_{f}\Gamma_{d}\dfngexp]^{n}\nonumber\\
& = & \frac{ (1+\Gamma_d)(1+\Gamma_{f})}{1+\Gamma_{f}\Gamma_{d}\dfngexp} 
\label{eq7}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that $n=0$ is when the initial wave enters the cable at the feed (where we assume we have set our reference plane).  We may identify $(1+\Gamma_d)$ as the voltage reception pattern of the antenna, denoted $\bmvolt(\thhat,\nu)$, which is a function of angle on the sky.  Additionally, $(1+\Gamma_f$) is the voltage efficiency for the feed (not a function of angle).

%As an aside, note that the sum in Eq. \ref{eq:Sigma} may be evaluated we may rewrite
%\begin{equation}
%{\volt_{rec}\over \volt_{sky} } =  (1+\Gamma_d)(1+\Gamma_{f})\frac{1+\Gamma_{f}^{N+1}\Gamma_{d}^{N+1}(\dfngexp)^{N+1}}{1+\Gamma_{f}%\Gamma_{d}\dfngexp} \nonumber
%\end{equation}
%which, in the limit becomes:
%\begin{equation}
%{\volt_{rec}\over \volt_{sky} } = \frac{ (1+\Gamma_d)(1+\Gamma_{f})}{1+\Gamma_{f}\Gamma_{d}\dfngexp} \nonumber
%\end{equation} 
%since $|\Gamma_d|$ and $|\Gamma_f|$ are less than one.

An accurate measurement of this quantity requires receiving $v_{sky}$ from a
well calibrated, wideband source in the sky in the far field of the HERA
antenna element with significant isotropic emission. While this condition is
hard to achieve in practice, due to the reciprocity of the antenna performance
in the transmission and reception mode, the right hand side of equation
\ref{eq7} could be measured using the return loss measurement technique with a
vector network analyzer (VNA). \\

\section{\textbf{Reflectometry measurements}} 

Reflectometry measurements are carried out at the HERA element prototype in
Green Bank, WV (Figure \ref{fig:heradish}) in order to measure the instrument
response of the feed and dish assembly and characterise the performance.  HERA
element consists off a $14\,m$ diameter parabolic reflector and a
crossed-dipole pair as a feed. The cross dipole antenna pair is identical to
the feed of the PAPER antenna which is suspended at the focal plane of the dish
with the support of three vertical poles. HERA elements are closely spaced with
centre to centre distance between two dishes are equal to the dish diameter.
Therefore, to reduce the coupling between the adjacent dishes, the crossed
dipole feed along with the back plane is encased in a cylindrical cage. The
feed is raised and lowered by a three-pulley system mounted on the three poles.
The focal height of the dish is $5m$.  The detail geometry and electromagnetic
design of of the feed is presented in deBoer et al 2016. \\

%A vector network analyser is connected via a 50feet long cable at the feed output of the HERA element and the return loss $(s_{11})$ of the HERA element is measured as a function of frequencies while the feed is suspended at the focal plane of the dish. 

 A VNA is connected to the HERA element via a 50-foot cable. It then transmits
a broadband noise voltage, $\volt_{trans}$, and a factor $(1+\Gamma_f)$ of this
voltage is radiated by the feed while the fraction $\Gamma_{f}$ returns to the
VNA. Although the radiated signal illuminates the dish and most of it is
radiated into free space, a fraction $\Gamma_d$ of this signal is reflected
back towards the feed, and $(1+\Gamma_f)$ is received by the VNA.  The received
voltage, after $n$ reflections between the dish and the feed (where again $n=0$
is the first reflected signal at the reference plane), is therefore:

\begin{eqnarray}
\volt_{rec} & = &  \Gamma_f \volt_{trans} \nonumber \\
         && + \volt_{trans} (1+\Gamma_f)^2 \Gamma_{d} \dfngexp \nonumber \\
         && + \volt_{trans} (1+\Gamma_f)^2 \Gamma_{d} \dfngexp \Gamma_d\Gamma_f\dfngexp \nonumber \\
         && + \volt_{trans} (1+\Gamma_f)^2 \Gamma_{d} \dfngexp (\Gamma_d\Gamma_f\dfngexp)^2 \nonumber \\
&&  ....+ \volt_{trans} (1+\Gamma_f)^2 \Gamma_{d} \dfngexp (\Gamma_d\Gamma_f\dfngexp)^n \nonumber \\
\label{eq8}
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, 
\begin{equation}
{\volt_{rec}\over \volt_{trans} } = \Gamma_f + \frac{(1+\Gamma_f)^2}{\Gamma_{f}} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N} [\Gamma_{f}\Gamma_{d}\dfngexp]^{n}
\label{eq9}
\end{equation}
The VNA measures the quantity $\volt_{rec}/\volt_{trans}=s_{11}$ which is the voltage reflection coefficient of the HERA element.
The fundamental differences between the right hand side of equations \ref{eq7} and \ref{eq9} are the $n=0$ term and the multiplicative factor in front of the convergent series $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N} [\Gamma_{f}\Gamma_{d}\dfngexp]^{n}$ that represents the contribution of the delayed voltage components at the VNA input, arising due to multiple signal reflections between the feed and the dish. Finally, writing $\volt_{rec}/\volt_{trans}=s_{11}$, equation \ref{eq9} can be written as,
\begin{equation}
s_{11} +\frac{(1+\Gamma_f)^2}{\Gamma_f}-\Gamma_f = \frac{(1+\Gamma_f)^2}{\Gamma_{f}} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^{N} [\Gamma_{f}\Gamma_{d}\dfngexp]^{n}
\label{eq10}
\end{equation}
Comparing to Eq. \ref{eq7} we find that
\begin{eqnarray}
{\volt_{rec}\over \volt_{sky} } & = & (1+\Gamma_d)\left[(1+\Gamma_f) + \frac{\Gamma_f}{(1+\Gamma_f)}\left(s_{11} - \Gamma_f\right)\right] \nonumber\\
 & = & \bmvolt(\thhat,\nu) \left[(1+\Gamma_f) + \frac{\Gamma_f}{(1+\Gamma_f)}\left(s_{11} - \Gamma_f\right)\right]
\label{eq11}
\end{eqnarray}
When the feed return loss is measured separately, all the higher order terms of equation \ref{eq9} do not exist. In this case, $\Gamma_f = s_{11}^{f}$. Using this measurement and the VNA measurement of $s11$, the quantity $v_{rec}\over v_{sky}$ is estimated. \\
%
\indent From this, for a two element interferometer with identical antenna elements, the ratio of the received sky intensity to true sky intensity will be, 
\begin{eqnarray}
{I_{rec}\over I_{sky} } & = & \Bigg|{\volt_{rec}\over \volt_{sky} }\Bigg|^2 =  \beam(\thhat,\nu)\times \nonumber\\
             && \left[|1+\Gamma_f|^2 +  2\operatorname{Re}\left(\frac{\Gamma_f}{(1+\Gamma_f)}(s_{11} - \Gamma_f)\right)\right] + \nonumber\\ 
             &&  \left[ \frac{|\Gamma_f|^2}{|1+\Gamma_{f}|^2}|s_{11} - \Gamma_f|^2  \right]  \nonumber\\
\label{eq12}             
\end{eqnarray}

In terms of visibility, the same could be written as,  
\begin{eqnarray}
\vis^{mul}(\vec b,\nu) & = & \int \beam(\thhat,\nu)\times \nonumber\\
             && \left[|1+\Gamma_f|^2 +  2\operatorname{Re}\left(\frac{\Gamma_f}{(1+\Gamma_f)}(s_{11} - \Gamma_f)\right)\right] + \nonumber\\ 
             &&  \left[ \frac{|\Gamma_f|^2}{|1+\Gamma_{f}|^2}|s_{11} - \Gamma_f|^2  \right]  I_{sky} \ifngexp d\Omega
\label{eq13}
\end{eqnarray}

Comparing equations \ref{eq13} and \ref{eq2}, the cross power generated by
$v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ would have a spurious visibility response due to the mutual
correlation between multiply reflected voltages represented by the second and
the third term of the right hand side of equation \ref{eq13}. In the ideal
case, $\Gamma_{f}=0$, in which case equation \ref{eq13} results in equation
\ref{eq2}. The Fourier transform of this visibility spectrum along the
frequency axis results in the delay spectrum.  In the delay domain,
visibilities contributed to by any two voltage components from two antennas
with no mutual delay will be located at the delay $\tau = 0$ whereas any two
voltage components from two antennas having a mutual delay of $n\Delta \tau$
will be centred at $n\Delta \tau$. These will broaden the width of the delay
spectrum, which ultimately interferes with the 21cm power spectrum detection.

\section{\textbf{Results}}
%Return loss measurements yields the instrument pass band response that would manifest in autocorrelation data of a single HERA element. Upon our assumption that two adjacent antenna elements have identical design parameters and electrical properties, this power is also a measure of the cross power or the visibility $\vis (\vec b, \nu)$ between the two antennas with a normalisation factor of $2$. 

Performance of the HERA feed and the dish-feed assembly has been simulated by
the em solver "High Frequency Structural Simulator(HFSS)" using the finite
element method.  The simulated and measured return loss of the feed, both
magnitude and phase are shown in the upper panel of the figure
\ref{RL_mag_dish}. While the simulated return loss of the feed structure shows
two resonant peaks around 120 and $160~MHz$, the feed resonance occur at
slightly higher frequencies. Notable are the difference in the shape of the
resonant peaks. While the simulated response shows very wide resonant peaks, as
expected from this dipole structures, the measured return loss of the feed has
a narrow peak around its low frequency resonance. This feature dominates the
fall off rate in the delay response of the system bandpass. The delay response
of the feed is shown in figure \ref{ds_feed_on_dish_trans}.

\end{figure}

Lower panel of the figure \ref{RL_mag_dish} shows the measured return loss when
the feed is suspended at the focal plane of the parabolic dish which is at $5m$
from the dish vertex. The measured return loss is much more complex than what
is found from the simulation. 
%To estimate the delay spectrum of the dish-feed assembly i.e one single HERA element, this measurement is first corrected to map the response of the antenna from transmitting mode to receiving mode via equation \ref{zero_delay_correction}. The corrected measurement is then Fourier transformed to obtain the delay spectrum of the instrument in the receiving mode as given in equation \ref{corrected_response}. 
Measurement bandwidth is kept much larger than the bandwidth of operation to
achieve higher delay resolution. A number of systematic effects as well as
mathematical artifacts that are critical to this measurement and their effects
on the corresponding estimation of the delay spectrum are taken in to account
in determination of the delay spectrum and described below. 

\subsection{Zero delay response}
%At first, the frequency domain measurement of s11 is Fourier-transformed to compute the response of the system in the delay domain. 

%\subsection{\textbf{Antenna beam pattern and feed return loss}}
%The return loss $\Gamma_{f}$ determines the amount of power coupled to the system via the feed antenna. Additionally, with each reflections, the power coupled to the system reduces by a factor of $\Gamma_{f}^{2}$. Since reflected signal results in system response in higher delay, multiple reflections of the signal off the feed and the dish would result in an exponential envelope in the delay spectrum.  The return loss of power results from the antenna impedance mismatch with the free space as well as the transmission line. While antenna beam pattern $A_{f}$ is a smooth function of frequency and should have its imprint confined to lower delays, the return loss $\Gamma_{f}$ broadens the delay spectrum. However, a smaller return loss will result in vertical shift of the delay spectrum at lower values and therefore can make the higher order reflections insignificant. 

During observation, each HERA element is connected to an active balun similar
to the ones used in the PAPER antenna which provides greater than 10dB return
loss of power at the feed output as is achieved in the measurement presented
here.These baluns are under further design improvements aiming at 10 to 20dB
better impedance match between the feed and the balun than the measurements
presented here.  Our measurement is done using a vector network analyzer for
which the active balun has been replaced by a passive balun.Given the antenna
impedance and the 50 Ohm transmission line the measurements are done using the
passive balun with a 4:1 impedance ratio. This measurements are conservative
estimate  for both $\Gamma_{f}$ and $s_{11}$.\\ While measuring the return loss
of the dish-feed assembly, the signal transmitted by the VNA is reflected first
off the feed. This is represented by $\Gamma_{f}$ in equation \ref{eq9}. This
essentially represents a mismatch in between the feed and the 50 Ohm
transmission line. In delay domain, this appears at the zero delay bin. The
zero delay response is identical whether or not the feed is suspended on the
dish. Therefore, we measure this response by measuring the feed return loss
alone while the feed is kept on the ground facing the sky. This results in feed
return loss alone including the surrounding cage structure but excluding the
dish response. While $\Gamma_{f}$ fraction of incident voltage is reflected off
the feed, $1+\Gamma_{f}$ fraction of the voltage is transmitted. In receiving
mode, upon initial incidence, $\Gamma_{f}$ fraction of voltage is reflected
back in to the space while $1+\Gamma_{f}$ voltage enters the feed. In receiving
mode, in delay domain, this appears at the zero delay bin.  The using the
return loss measurement of the feed $(\Gamma_{f})$, the return loss measurement
$s_{11}$ of the dish and feed assembly is corrected via equation \ref{eq11} and
the quantity of interest ${I_{rec}\over I_{sky}}$ is estimated. 


\subsection{Dish reflections}

Measurement equations shows the effects of multiple reflections of the sky
signal between the feed and the dish. Any other reflections off the feed
structure and/or any other part of the dish-feed assembly would appear at
arbitrary delays. The estimated delay spectrum of the instrument is
collectively contributed by all the reflections. Delay spectrum estimated from
the return loss measurement of the feed alone,  provides the lowest limit of
the delay spectrum of the instrument considering there is no multiple
reflections in between the feed and the dish.  From figure
\ref{ds_feed_on_dish_trans}, at lower delays, the reflections are dominated by
the feed structure. Therefore, the delay spectrum in both the cases follow each
other. Since the distance between the feed and the dish is 5 m, the roundtrip
delay between the dish and the feed as about $30~ns$. Hence, the dish
reflection is expected to manifest themselves at an integral multiple of
$30~ns$. The diameter of the feed cavity is $172~cm$  that results in signal
reflections every integral multiple of $\approx2.86~ns$. The combined effect of
feed and the dish dominates the delay spectrum up to $\> 50nS$ after which the
dish reflections starts to dominate and the two delay spectrum deviates from
each other. With some manipulation of the equation \ref{eq10}, we can estimate
the dish return loss $\Gamma_{d}$ and corresponding delay spectrum as shown in
the figure \ref{dish_delay_spectrum}.

\subsection{Multiple reflection between the feed and the backend.}

Another effect that spill over of the smooth foreground power at higher delays
is the multiple reflection of the received signal between the feed output and
the input of the analog backend and correlators. In our measurements, the feed
output is connected to the VNA via a 50 feet long LMR 400 cable. This length
correspond to a delay of $\approx 120~nS$ for the signals travelling through
the cable. The delay spectrum of both feed and feed-dish assembly shows an
enhanced feature at this delay indicating a reflection from the VNA input. We
measure the VNA input reflections by disconnecting the feed and connecting an
open load at the feed input of the cable. The measured return loss is shown in
the figure \ref{fig:open_RL}. Since the electromagnetic wave travelling through
a transmission line undergoes a $100\%$ reflections from an open ended
transmission line, we compute the combined effect of the VNA input return loss
along with the cable resistive loss from this measurement as shown in figure
\ref{fig:open_RL}. This results an important system design criterion for HERA.
The VNA input return loss is found to be at a level of $-14$ to $-30dB$ across
the measurement band. This is consistent with the matched provided by the
commercially available RF connectors that are commonly used. This manifests
itself in a peak in the delay spectrum which is $50~dB$ above the measurement
noise floor. The delays at which this effect becomes dominant depends on the
length of the cable. Due to finite return loss at the input of the backends,
this effect will be present in all the observations and thus would impact the
instrument delay spectrum. However, its effect could be reduced below the level
where the foreground  achieving a return loss at the backend input is greater
than at least $-30~dB$.

Ideally, for an open load, the electromagnetic wave travelling through the transmission cable undergoes a $100\%$ reflections and magnitude of the return loss is $0dB$. However, due to the resistive loss in the cable, the a small part of the signal is dissipated in the cable resulting a smaller return loss.  Right: Delay spectrum of the open load that shows the multiple reflections at the VNA input. The delay spectrum of the feed and the feed-dish assembly is also plotted for comparison.}
\label{fig:open_RL}       
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Measurement bandwidth and window function}

Estimation of the delay spectrum by taking the Fourier transform of the
measured return loss is sensitive to the bandwidth of measurements. Since the
measurements are done in the spectral domain, measurement between two
frequencies is analogous to windowing the frequency domain data by a square
window function. In the delay domain, Fourier transform of this would result in
multiple side lobes at higher delays. Therefore, appropriate windowing of the
data is  necessary prior to taking the Fourier transform of the measured data.
Figure \ref{fig:window} shows the delay spectrum estimated from the measured
data using a square window as well as Blackman Harris window. Windowing the
data prior to Fourier transform significantly reduces the system response
higher delays.  

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{GB_reflectometry_part3/plot/ds_window.png}
\caption{Effect of finite bandwidth on estimation of delay spectrum: Blue line shows the delay spectrum of the HERA element computed from the measured data which is band limited between 100 to 200MHz. Green line shows the delay spectrum estimated from the same data set after multiplying the data by a Blackman Harris window. The delay spectrum of the windowed data set shows significant reduction in the instrument response at higher delays.}
\label{fig:window}
\end{figure} 

%While measuring the return loss of the dish-feed assembly, the signal transmitted by the VNA is reflected first off the feed. This is represented by $\Gamma_{f}$ in equation \ref{eq:power_ratio}. This essentially represents a mismatched impedance between the feed and the 50 Ohm transmission line. In the delay domain, this appears at the zero delay bin. This response is identical whether or not the feed is suspended on the dish. We can, therefore, quantify this response by measuring the feed return loss while the feed is kept on the ground facing the sky. This results in a feed return loss including the surrounding cage structure but excluding the dish response. While a fraction, $\Gamma_{f}$, of the power is reflected off the feed, $1+\Gamma_{f}$ gets transmitted. In the receiving mode, upon initial incidence, $\Gamma_{f}$ of the voltage is reflected back into free space while $1+\Gamma_{f}$ enters the feed, and, in the delay domain, this appears at the zero delay bin. Using the return loss measurement of the feed $(\Gamma_{f})$ and the return loss measurement, $s_{11}$, of the dish, the feed assembly is corrected via equation \ref{eq:power_ratio} for the zero delay component, and the quantity of interest ${I_{rec}\over I_{sky}}$ is estimated.

%\label{fig:delay_spectrum}
%\end{figure}
\subsection{Delay spectrum of sub bands}

The dominant term in the expression of  return loss of the HERA element in
receiving mode (\ref{eq11}) is the zero delay term $(1+\Gamma_{f})$. As
mentioned earlier, the feed reflection coefficient $\Gamma_{a}$ shows two
resonances in between 100-140~MHz and 160-200~MHz. While the one at high
frequency is a wider peak, the low frequency resonance shows a sharp feature in
frequency. This dominates the overall shape of the delay spectrum in figure
\ref{ds_feed_on_dish_trans}.\\ Also, In HERA analysis, the 21~cm power spectrum
is estimated by gridding the observed data along the line of sight distance i.e
is in frequency or redshift and spatial frequency scale
$k$~\citep{liu_et_al2014a}. At particular redshift, the bandwidth of
observation is so chosen that over the corresponding $\Delta z$, the 21~cm
signal does not significantly evolve. Typically, the the 21~cm brightness
temperature fluctuation evolve over redshift scale $\Delta
z>0.5$~\citep{loeb_zaldarriaga2004},~\citep{lidz_et_al2008}. Hence, the delay
spectrum is estimated over smaller bandwidths.\\ We estimate the instrument
delay spectrum over various sub bands between 100 to 200~MHz as shown in figure
\ref{ds_full_sub_band}. Each panel of figure \ref{ds_full_sub_band} shows the
delay spectrum estimated from the returnloss measurement of the HERA element
between 100-200, 100-140, 140-160, 160 to 200~MHz respectively. Each panel also
compares the estimated delay spectrum with two simulated delay spectra. The
blue curve is the delay spectrum estimated from the simulated return loss of
the feed and the feed-dish assembly that is shown in figure
\ref{ds_feed_on_dish_trans}. Sub band delay spectra are wider compared to full
band delay spectrum.  Shape of the resonant peaks determines the roll of rate
of the delay spectrum in the range of 100-140~MHz and 160~200MHz. At higher
frequency, our measurements closely follows the em simulations except around
120~ns where the cable reflection between the antenna and the backend manifests
itself at all frequencies. \\ The shaded region of each panel shows the EoR to
foreground power ratio required for detection of 21~cm power spectrum at those
individual delays~\citep{Thyagarajan_et_al2016}. This ratio is computed by
using the HFSS simulation of chromatic antenna beam as well as return loss
(figure \ref{RL_mag_dish}) and the sky models. Diffused sky foreground model is
incorporated from~\citep{deolivieracosta_et_al2008} whereas the point source
contribution is estimated by combining the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) at
1.42~GHz~\citep{Condon_1998}, Sydney University Molonglo sky Survey (SUMSS)
~\citep{Bock_et_al_1999}, \citep{Mauch_et_al_2003} at 843~MHz. The EoR signal
is simulated by using 21cmFAST \citep{Messinger_et_al2011}. The model
parameters used by~\cite{Thyagarajan_et_al2016} for the EoR signal simulation
are : Virial temperature of minimum mass of dark matter halos that host
ionizing sources, $T_{vir}^{min} = 2*10^4 K$, Ionising efficiency $\eta = 20$,
Mean Free Path of UV photons $R_{mfp} = 15Mpc.$ For these model parameter
values, the redshift of $50\%$ reionization is predicted to be at $z = 8.5$ at
150MHz.  Ideally, the delay response of the smooth foreground is confined at
lower delays whereas the same for the EoR signal is spread across the entire
delay range. However, due to system chromaticity of the simulated response of
the HERA element, foreground spills over the higher delays.
~\cite{Thyagarajan_et_al2016} computes the required attenuation of the
foreground with respect to the EoR power available at that delay in order for a
detection of the EoR signal at that delay mode. It is shown that for a given
delay mode, the estimate of a lower $k_{\parallel}$ mode requires a higher
attenuation compared to a higher $k_{\parallel}$ mode. (For details
~\cite{Thyagarajan_et_al2016}).

\section{\textbf{Effect of instrument delay spectrum on 21cm power spectrum measurements}}

21cm power spectrum measurements are limited by challenges posed by the low
frequency radio foreground that is order of magnitude brighter than the
expected power spectrum amplitude. While PAPER has established the till date
the most stringent upper limit on the 21cm power spectrum measurement, the need
for increased sensitivity called for increased collecting area per PAPER
element. This has driven to the parabolic reflector antenna based design of the
PAPER successor HERA where essentially the PAPER antenna with minor
modification of the ground plane-side plane assembly works as the feed and thus
having larger collecting area per element. Additional limitations on PAPER and
its contemporaries are imposed by the spectral structure of the system
response. Sky signal is frequency modulated by the system bandpass response. In
delay spectrum technique of 21cm power spectrum estimation, sky signal is
convolved with the system response in the delay domain. In this process of
convolution, the frequency dependent system response with rapid frequency
variation results in spreading of the smooth spectrum foreground of the sky
signal to the delays in which EoR power spectrum is to be estimated. This
essentially limits the capacity of any experiment to probe the smaller spatial
scales of fluctuations. \\ Figure \ref{fig:sim_em} and \ref{fig:sim_pk} shows
the measurement presented this paper in comparison with the simulations.
Simulations and measurements are in good agreement with each other up to around
$60~ns$ up to which the structures in the delay domain are mostly caused due to
signal reflections in the feed structure. Since the simulated return loss shows
a better match of the antenna to the 50 Ohm transmission line. At zero delay ,
in case of simulation, almost $100\%$ of the sky signal is received whereas in
case of measurements, this match is found to be less than $5~dB$ resulting in
partial coupling of the sky signal to the system. Given all the reflections
unaltered, if the matching in between the feed and the transmission line is
improved by about $10~dB$, which is achievable in reality, the delay spectrum
would improve substantially. This is plotted in grey. The work is currently
under progress to improve the feed return loss at least by  $10dB$ (Eloy et al
2016 in prep?). Beyond $60~nS$ other multiple reflections manifests themselves
at higher delays and the delay spectrum of the measurement and simulations
begin to deviate from each other.\\ Thyagarajan et al 2016) has presented the
detailed sensitivity calculations of HERA is using a comprehensive foreground
model as well as model for EoR power spectrum for various simulated antenna
element response. The sensitivity is quantified as a ratio of EoR signal power
to the foreground power at various $\bold k_{\parallel}$ mode i.e at various
delays. The theoretical limits for the level of foreground attenuation required
relative to the EoR signal in order to reduce the foreground contaminations at
the delay modes significant for power spectrum measurements are shown for three
different lower limits of $k_\parallel$ values.  The response is computed for
the redshift of $z=8.47$ at frequency $150~MHz$ over a bandwidth of $10~MHz$.
This simulation shows the effect of chromatic antenna response and how that
contaminates the delay modes beyond the horizon limit. Thus, this establishes a
very stringent limits of required foreground attenuation relative to EoR signal
which demands almost an ideal system performance. \\

%As shown in section (), multiple reflection in the antenna system generates multiple copies of the sky signal and thus results in additional foreground contaminations in the delay modes where EOR power spectrum is measurable in case of no reflections. Reflectometry measurements shows the relative strength with which the multiple copies of the signal shows up at various delays.

The HERA analysis pipeline for power spectrum estimation exploits the inverse covariance weighting technique to reduce the foreground contribution to the measured visibility data. In the light of this analysis technique we further investigate the limits of required instrumental delay response from what is established by foreground simulation in Thyagarajan et al 2016. In the following section we briefly describe the power spectrum estimation technique used in HERA analysis and the inverse covariance weighting. In the next section we evaluate the estimated instrument delay response performance in the context of covariance weighting.

\subsection{Power spectrum estimation:}

HERA power spectrum estimation is done using the Optimal Quadratic Estimator
(OQE) formalism that has been outlined in extensive detail in (Liu and Tegmark
2011), (Dillon et al 2013), (Liu et al 2014a,2014b), (Trott et al 2016), (Ali
et al 2015). We briefly  describe the OQE formalism here.\\ HERA instrument
aims at measuring the redshifted 21~cm power spectrum
$P_{21}(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$, conventionally written as, 

\begin{equation}
\langle  \tilde T_{b}(\bold k) \tilde T_{b}^{*}(\bold k^{'}) \rangle = (2\pi)^{3} \delta (\bold k - \bold k^{'})P_{21}(k_\perp,k_\parallel)
\label{eq14}
\end{equation}

where $\langle  \tilde T_{b}(\bold k) \tilde T_{b}^{*}(\bold k^{'}) \rangle $ is the correlation function of the three dimensional spatial Fourier transform of the sky brightness temperature distribution $ \tilde T_{b}(\bold k)$, and $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function. While both $P_{21}(k_\perp,k_\parallel), \tilde T_{b}({\bold k})$ is continuous, the power spectrum could only be estimated at discrete values of $\bold k$. Observation frequency and bandwidth are so chosen that the power spectrum could e approximated as a constant and a piecewise continuous function of $\bold k$  which correspond to a thin shell in $\bold k$ space. This corresponds to the $k_{perp}$, $k_{parallel}$  values $a <k_{\perp} < a+1$, $b <k_{\parallel} < b+1$ where the indices a, b can assume M, N different values.  We denote the power spectrum as $\hat p_{\alpha}$ where alpha represents a particular $(M,N)$ value. Our analysis begins with a data vector $\bold x$. $\bold x$ is the list of visibilities measured at a given frequency over a certain bandwidth i.e for a given $k_{\parallel}$ mode for a given $\Delta \bold k $. The first estimate of power spectrum is written as, 

\begin{equation}
\hat q_{\alpha} = \bold x^{T} E^{\alpha} \bold x  - b^{\alpha}
\label{eq15}
\end{equation}

where $b_{\alpha}$ is a constant that assumes different values for each $\bold k$ and represents any additive noise power spectrum or residual foreground contamination to power spectrum estimate. $b_{\alpha}$ could be eliminated from the estimate by cross correlating two visibility data sets at two different times. $E^{\alpha}$ is a symmetric matrix operation denoting the Fourier transform of the data, binning, and foreground reduction. Various binning and foreground reduction technique would result in various different form of $E^{\alpha}$ resulting in estimates of $\hat p_{\alpha}$ with non identical statistics. A possible choice of $E^{\alpha}$ is
\begin{equation}
E^{\alpha} =  {1 \over 2} C^{-1} Q_{\alpha} C^{-1}
\label{eq16}
\end{equation} 

where $C = \langle \bold x \bold x^{t} \rangle$ is the covariance matrix of the data vector $\bold x$. $Q_{\alpha} \equiv {\delta C \over \delta p_{\alpha} } $ is a matrix operator that Fourier transforms the visibilities along the frequency axis and maps them into the $\bold k$ space for every M,N values. Finally, the normalized estimate of the power spectrum could be written as,  
\begin{equation}
\hat p_{\alpha} = M \hat q_{\alpha} 
\label{eq17}
\end{equation} 

Since $\hat p_{\alpha}$ is a discrete estimate of the true power spectrum $p_{\alpha}$, both are related by the window function matrix $W$, 
\begin{equation}
\hat p_{\alpha} = W p_{\alpha}
\label{eq18}
\end{equation} 

Hence, the estimated power spectrum $\hat p_{\alpha}$ for a given $k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel}$ values would have contribution for the nearby $k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel}$ values weighted by the window function. The wider the window function, the larger would be the contribution of the adjacent modes to the discrete power spectrum estimate. In general, therefore, $W$ is a non-diagonal matrix. Also, for a given choice of normalization matrix M, the window function W will be, 

\begin{equation}
 W = MF
 \label{eq19}
\end{equation} 

where , 
\begin{equation}
 F_{\alpha\beta} = \frac {1} { 2} [C^{-1}Q_{\alpha}C^{-1}Q_{\beta}]^{T}
 \label{eq20}
\end{equation} 
 is the Fisher matrix of the measured data. The choice of normalization matrix $M$ is critically important for the analysis. If $M = F^{-1}$, $W=I$ resulting in $\hat p_{\alpha} = p_{\alpha}$ i.e, estimated value of the power spectrum equals to the true power spectrum.\\
 The errors on the power spectrum estimate is given by the covariance of the band power which could be computed from the measured data as,  
\begin{eqnarray}
 C_{\alpha} & = & \langle \hat p_{\alpha} \hat p_{\alpha}^{T} \rangle - \langle \hat p_{\alpha} \rangle \langle \hat p_{\alpha}^{T} \rangle \nonumber\\
 		& = & MFM^{T}
\label{eq21}
 \end{eqnarray} 
 
 For a choice of $M = F^{-1}$, the covariance in the estimated band power is as large as $M$ resulting in highest error in estimation. Hence, the choice of the normalization matrix $M$ is critical in the analysis process since its precise form determines the vertical error bars in the estimate of power spectrum. 

\subsection{Inverse covariance weighting: revised delay spectrum limit}

The inverse variance weighting method is a method of aggregating two or more
random variable to minimize the variance in their weighted average. In our
case, the measured visibility is contributed by EoR, foreground and
instrumental noise. Hence, the estimate of any of the constituent signal would
benefit from if the measured data is weighted by the covariance of the
individual components. This is reflected in our choice of the matrix
$E^{\alpha}$.  $E^{\alpha} = {1 \over 2} C^{-1} Q_{\alpha} C^{-1}$ represents a
weighting of the data vector $\bold x$ by inverse of its covariance. This
results in the smallest vertical error bar in the power spectrum estimate $\hat
p_{\alpha}$ (Reference Liu 2011).  However, there no definite way to know the
covariance of individual signal components prior to estimating them. In
practice, the total covariance matrix $C$ is computed from the measured
visibilities. It is a sum of covariances of the foreground, instrumental noise
and the EoR signals. The highest covariance is rendered by the signal which is
correlated over various frequency channels at all frequencies such as
foreground. Hence, weighting the measured visibility by the inverse of the
covariance results in order of magnitude reduction of foreground power against
the EoR signal \\ Combining the inverse covariance weighting formalism with the
foreground simulation of Thyagarajan et al 2016, we derive a new limit on
required foreground attenuation with respect to the EoR signal, required for
power spectrum estimation using HERA measurements. The foreground model of
Thyagarajan et al (2015a) is adopted wherein the diffused emission is accounted
for using de Oliviera-Costa et al. 2008 and the point sources are modeled using
NRAO VLA sky survey at 1.42 GHz(NVSS, Condon et al 1998) and Sydney University
Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS; Bock et al 199;Mauch et al 2003.) at 843 MHz. The
EoR signal model is derived from the 21cmFAST (Messinger et al 2011). We use
the reflectometry measurements, corrected for the antenna response in the
receiving mode, to compute the visibilities (eq 13) for the given model of the
foreground, the EoR and the system noise. These visibilities formed the complex
data vector $\bold x$. We compute the covariance matrix $C$ from the simulated
data. $\bold x$ is then multiplied by the inverse of the covariance matrix.
This step essentially weighs down the foreground contribution to the measured
data. Once Fourier transformed, the delay spectrum of the simulated data is
constituted by linear super position of the delay spectrum of the foreground,
the EoR signal.  We again compute the EoR to foreground power ratio which is
now smaller than what is estimated in Thyagarajan et al 2016 as shown in
fig:\ref{fig:sim_fg_revised}.

\label{fig:sim_fg_revised}
\end{figure*}
This demonstrates that the performance of the HERA element performance, in conjunction with the inverse covariance method of foreground suppression, qualifies the system for its the science goal it is designed for, irrespective of its chromatic response generated due to multiple reflections in the system.

\section{\textbf{Conclusion}}

The interplay between the extremely bright sky signal with the system response
has remained somewhat undermined for the first generation 21cm experiments such
as MWA, LOFAR, PAPER. With the theory of redshifted 21cm experiments have very
well evolved, it is absolute necessity now to quantify the instrumental limits
of these measurement in order to produce a believable power spectrum estimates.
In this paper, we studied the performance of a HERA element in both frequency
as well as delay domain. The effects of multiple reflections  in a HERA
feed-dish assembly is investigated in detail and their effects on the measured
visibility as well as delay spectrum is estimated.  The delay-domain
performance of the HERA dish is central to HERA's function as a power spectrum
instrument. Reflectometry measurements characterised HERA's performance in this
domain, and as Equation \ref{eq10} shows, these measurements must be adjusted
for a difference in transmission/reflection at the first feed encounter in
order to be interpreted as the delay response of a feed relative to an incident
plane wave from the sky.  It is also shown that the choice of windowing
function is critical for accurately measuring the antenna delay response at
higher delays, where sidelobes from much higher amplitude responses at small
delays can easily dominate.  Blackman-Harris window is found to be generally
adequate while square windowing functions are not.  Given the critical nature
of the windowing function, it is recommended that all reflectometry
measurements be performed in the frequency domain, so that the data could be
Fourier transformed with the appropriate window.  The delay spectrum estimates
are then compared with the electromagnetic as well as time domain simulation of
the HERA element~\citep{Ewall-Wice_et_al2016}, ~\citep{ddboer_et_al2016}. The
same is then compared with the foreground simulation
of~\cite{Thyagarajan_et_al2015}. The performance is also evaluated in the light
of HERA power spectrum estimation technique using inverse covariance weighting
formalism.  Taken all together, we summarise that the HERA antenna element,
with a PAPER-style crossed dipole feed and cylindrical cage the instrument
delay spectrum very well satisfies the criteria necessary to meet its science
goal.

Aaron: 
Details of simulations in delay space of HERA and PAPER
Calibration off zenith vs. off-zenith (not possible in 2 weeks), -> spec instead of prediction
Simulations are inconsistent off-zenith
Could use Nithya FGs or own to compare with fg leakage to sensitivity, propagate to foreground constraints
assumes cut at 460 ns, based on conservative simulation extrapolation
will try to explore a range of delay profiles
does not create a spec

Nithya:
Details of EoR and FG levels for HERA
link science side to a spec for instrument
pitchfork effect, spatial FG weighting using model beams
show contamination as a function of lst, average contamination
impact of inverse covariance weighting on delay kernel -> Parsons + Liu?
match k spec with Aaron EW
Need updated beams (DeBoer will simulate, Parsons or Aguirre will bin)

Abraham:
Orbcomm beam measurements w/ 2 feed heights
Compare measurements to models
Models go to achromatic models for Nithya
Use range of models/measurements and foregrounds to explore error on horizon brightening
Thermal noise predictions (beam area), carrying through to predictions of thermal noise pspec using 21cmsense
Compare to Airy?

Nipanjana:
Reflectometry measurements
Derivation of relationship of Reflectometry to delay spectrum performance
Motivation for dishes vs dipoles
comparison with simulations, autocorr measurements
comparison with PAPER "establish heritage"
compare reflectometry measurements with fg specs on dish performance

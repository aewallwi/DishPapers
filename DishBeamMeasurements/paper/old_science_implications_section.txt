We assess the level of foreground leakage into the EOR window due to beam shape, baseline length, and LST. In particular, we built on the study of \citet{nithya15} of the impact of beam shape and horizon response on foreground spectral structure and containment in the wedge.

We simulate delay spectra for several model and measured beams on different baseline lengths for different LSTs and baseline orientations. All these factors affect the level of emission horizon brightening in delay space, the ``pitchfork'' effect, and the level of foreground leakage. We assume a constant beam pattern over that band, with leakage due only to the finite bandwidth and choice of window function. Actual frequency structure imprinted onto the foregrounds by variation of the beam angular pattern or overall gain with frequency (Patra et al.)

We begin by simulating visibilities over a 20\,MHz bandwidth with  400\,kHz resolution centered on 137\,MHz on two different baselines for two model beams (airy, and CST sim) and two measured beams (measured nominal focus beam, and measured nominal focus beam with $60^\circ$ cutoff). We use the short and maximally redundant 14\,m baseline, most useful for delay spectrum analysis, as well as a longer 42\,m baseline, more useful for imaging analysis. From these frequency-sequenced visibilities we calculate the delay spectrum  \citep{perbaselinetechnique} using the Blackman-Harris window following \citet{nithya15}. This window reduces the noise equivalent bandwidth to 10\,MHz, corresponding to $\Delta z\sim0.5$, beyond which evolution of the cosmological signal become significant. Larger bandwidths, though, are useful for foreground estimation and delay-space deconvolution \citep{parsonsandbacker,paper32,paper64}. With this caveat, our simulated delay spectra show the worst case scenario, quantifying the level of foreground isolation without estimation and deconvolution.

Our sky model is comprised of a deep MWA point source survey within 20$^\circ$ of R.A.(J2000) $= 0^\text{h}\,0^\text{m}\,0^\text{s}$ and decl.(J2000) $= -30^\circ\,0'\,0''$ (Carroll et al., in prep.), the shallower but wider MWA commissioning point source survey\citep{MWACS}, the Culgoora catalog\citep{Slee1995}, and the Global Sky Model of Galactic radio emission \citep{gsm}. 

Figure \ref{fig:delayspec} shows the delay spectra at $0^\circ$ (top pair) and $60^\circ$ (bottom pair) LST for 14\,m (left pair) and 42\,m (right pair) EW baselines. For reference we plot a 1D model 21\,m power spectrum for $z\sim8$ from \citet{21cmfast}. Consider first the $0^\circ$ LST plots where the Galactic disk has nearly, but not completely set. The effect of horizon response is most visible on the longer 42\,m baseline where the measured beam (red) and CST model (yellow), both show significant brightening at the horizon delays (vertical black lines) due to roughly -30\,dB beam response near the horizon, as discussed by \citet{nithya15,nithya15}. In contrast, the airy model (black) and measured beam with cutoff (blue) show no significant brightening at the horizon, where they appear still to be dominated by the wings of the delay PSF from the emission closer to zero delay. 

We also plot (green dashed line) the delay spectrum after subtracting the visibilities computed with the $\theta\sim60^\circ$ cutoff measured beam from those using the full measured beam. This curve may be interpreted as the uncertainty in the ``pitchfork'' horizon brightening due to uncertainty in the beam horizon response, or equivalently as the delay spectrum residual foregrounds after subtracting foregrounds in the well modeled region of the sky (Neben et al. 2015b, submitted). By construction, this subtraction leaves emission from the highest delay regions of the sky (near the horizon on opposite sides of the baseline), but also leaves some low delay emission on opposite sides of a line perpendicular to the baseline. However, this additional low delay emission near the horizon gets drowned out by that from near zenith where the beam is substantially stronger. 

On the shorter 14\,m baseline, the horizon brightening is smaller because there is roughly an order of magnitude more emission at zero delay, whose thereby stronger delay wings, which are also relatively wider compared to the narrower foreground wedge, cover up much of the edge brightening. At $60^\circ$ LST, effect of horizon response is much smaller as the Galactic disk is now entirely below the horizon. 

The level of leakage depends also on baseline orientation which sets which directions on the sky map to large delays. Figure \ref{fig:delayspec2} shows the delay spectra at $0^\circ$ LST on 14\,m NE (top pair) and SE (bottom pair) baselines. Both show increased edge brightening compared to the 14\,m EW baseline. \citet{nithya15} proposes to identify through modeling the baselines most susceptible to this edge brightening at any given time, and simply exclude them from the power spectrum analysis.
